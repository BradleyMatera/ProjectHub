# ProjectHub

A script that adds an AI-powered chat bot to your website, showcasing my web development projects, CodePens, and skills. The chat bot is designed to respond naturally to any input, remember the conversation context, and provide detailed insights into my work as a Web Development student at Full Sail University.

## Usage

To add the ProjectHub chat bot to your website, simply include the following script tag in your HTML:

```html
<script src="https://bradleymatera.github.io/ProjectHub/ProjectHub.js"></script>
```

This will add a chat interface to the bottom-right corner of your webpage, where users can interact with the bot to learn more about my projects, skills, and background.

## Features

- **AI-Powered Chat**: The bot uses an external AI to handle a wide range of queries naturally, even for unrelated topics, while prioritizing predefined responses for project-related questions.
- **Conversation Memory**: The bot remembers the conversation context, allowing for more coherent and personalized interactions.
- **Project Showcase**: Users can ask about my projects (e.g., "Tell me about Interactive Pokedex") or CodePens (e.g., "Tell me about React Calculator") to get detailed information, including descriptions, tech stacks, and links.
- **Bio and Skills**: Users can ask for a summary of me as a web developer (e.g., "Summarize Bradley as a web dev") to learn about my education, skills, certifications, and experience.
- **Natural Tone**: Responses are crafted in a casual, conversational tone to make interactions feel friendly and approachable.
- **Custom Queries**: The bot can handle any input, from project-related questions to general inquiries, by leveraging the AI to provide meaningful responses while steering the conversation back to my work when appropriate.
- **GitHub and LinkedIn Links**: Users can ask for my GitHub or LinkedIn profile (e.g., "What’s Bradley’s GitHub?") to get direct links and a brief overview of what they’ll find there.

## Examples

Here are some example queries you can try with the chat bot:

- **Project Inquiry**: "Tell me about Interactive Pokedex"  

- **CodePen Inquiry**: "Tell me about React Calculator"  

- **Summary Request**: "Summarize Bradley as a web dev"  

- **Full Summary**: "Full summary" (after asking for a summary)  
  
- **General Query**: "What’s the weather like?"
